You may post NSFW content, but you MUST tag them as NSFW \(to do so, click on the three-dots icon and choose \`NSFW\`\). **Porn** however, is not allowed on Voten! No matter the type. For example you may post an artwork containing nudity, but you can't post a hentai image. If it helps, think of the same rules Instagram uses.
